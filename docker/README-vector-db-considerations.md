**Fantastic — this is the right question if you’re planning production vector search. Let’s make it super practical.**

Let’s say you have:

* **1,000 embeddings** stored in Postgres PGVector
* You’re running a **TOP-K = 4** query
* Using e.g. 1536-dimension embeddings (like `text-embedding-3-small`)

You’re wondering:

> **How fast is this? What performance can I expect?**

# ✅ How PGVector Search Works

When you run:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_vectors
ORDER BY embedding <-> query_embedding
LIMIT 4;
```

→ PGVector does:

* **an exact distance calculation** (Euclidean `<->` or cosine `<=>`)
* computes distances between your query vector and **all 1,000 rows**
* returns the 4 closest matches

**By default, PGVector does a linear scan** if no index is set up. So:

* time grows linearly with the number of rows
* but for small datasets (like 1,000 rows) → it’s still extremely fast

---

# ✅ Realistic Benchmarks (1,000 vectors)

### No Index

With no index, and on modern hardware:

✅ Expect **\~1–10 milliseconds** per TOP-4 query.

* PGVector computes:

  ```
  distance(query_vector, stored_vector)
  ```

  → across all 1,000 rows
* Postgres can easily do this for small tables in memory.

---

## Benchmarks from PGVector Docs

From PGVector’s official benchmarks:

* 1,000 rows → \~1–2 ms per query
* 10,000 rows → \~10 ms per query
* 1 million rows → hundreds of ms unless you add an index

---

## ✅ With an Index (IVFFlat)

When you grow beyond 10,000 vectors, use **IVFFlat** indexing.

Steps:

1. Create the index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON my_vectors
USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 100);
```

2. Analyze:

```sql
ANALYZE my_vectors;
```

IVFFlat:

✅ speeds up searches dramatically for large datasets
✅ but requires:

* building the index upfront
* tuning parameters (like `lists`)

With only 1,000 rows, you **won’t see big benefits** because scanning 1,000 vectors is already very fast.

---

## ✅ Practical Example

Let’s time it.

Suppose your embeddings table has:

* 1,000 rows
* each vector = 1536 floats

---

### Example Query (linear scan)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_vectors
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.1, -0.2, ...]'
LIMIT 4;
```

On a laptop or small cloud server:

✅ Time: **\~1–5 milliseconds** per query

---

### Example Query (with index)

With IVFFlat:

✅ Time: \~0.3–2 milliseconds per query

…but for 1,000 rows, the overhead of the index might be **slower** than just scanning.

---

## ✅ Factors That Affect Timing

✅ **Vector size** (dimension)

* 1536 dimensions → fast enough
* 8,000+ dims → slower dot products

✅ **CPU & RAM**

* PGVector stays fast if data fits in RAM
* Disk I/O slows things down

✅ **Distance metric**

* Cosine → slightly more computation than Euclidean
* Both are fast for 1,000 rows

✅ **Parallelism**

* Postgres parallelizes queries if data size grows

---

## ✅ Ballpark Performance

Here’s a rough guide:

| # of Vectors | No Index   | IVFFlat              |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------------- |
| 1,000        | \~1-5 ms   | \~2 ms (no big gain) |
| 10,000       | \~10-20 ms | \~3-5 ms             |
| 100,000      | \~100 ms   | \~5-10 ms            |
| 1M+          | > 500 ms   | \~10-50 ms           |

So at 1,000 vectors:

✅ **No index = perfectly fine.**

---

# ✅ LangChain Perspective

In LangChain:

```python
results = vectorstore.similarity_search("my query", k=4)
```

LangChain:

* Embeds your query (e.g. OpenAI Embeddings → \~10–20ms API call)
* Sends the vector to Postgres
* Retrieves the top-k documents

✅ **Embedding step is usually slower** than PGVector search itself if you’re using cloud embeddings.

---

## ✅ Realistic End-to-End Timing

For 1,000 rows:

* **Embedding call (OpenAI)** → \~10–20 ms
* **PGVector search** → \~1–5 ms
* **Total latency** → \~15–30 ms

Super fast for most applications.

---

## ✅ Should You Index for 1,000 Rows?

✅ **No.**

* Not worth the effort
* Linear scan is faster for small tables

Indexing shines once you cross \~10,000 rows.

---

# ✅ TL;DR

✅ PGVector can easily handle **TOP-4 searches on 1,000 vectors in \~1–5 ms**.
✅ You **don’t need an index yet** for such a small dataset.
✅ Main bottleneck for small datasets = embedding call latency, not PGVector.

---

**Bottom line:**

> With 1,000 vectors, PGVector will give you **blazing fast TOP-4 searches** — almost instant.
