**Fantastic question — this is one of the most important differences between “traditional” Linux disk usage and Docker.**

Let’s clarify how disk sizing works in Docker.

---

# ✅ Traditional Linux Partitions

On traditional Linux:

✅ You **must declare disk sizes upfront.**

* E.g. `/dev/sda1 = 20GB`
* Filesystems like ext4, xfs, etc. sit on top of those partitions.
* To grow them, you often have to:

  * resize partitions
  * extend LVM volumes
  * grow a virtual disk

**Example:**

```bash
fdisk /dev/sda
```

→ create partitions of fixed sizes.

---

# ✅ Docker — No Fixed Disk Size Per Container

**Docker works completely differently.**

✅ **You do NOT have to declare a “disk size” when you create a Docker container.**

Instead:

* Containers share the **host’s filesystem space** under:

  ```
  /var/lib/docker
  ```

* Each container’s writable layer is a folder managed by the Docker storage driver (overlay2, aufs, etc.).

When you run a container:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash
```

* Docker just gives that container a writable layer on top of the base image.
* No disk size declared.

---

## ✅ How Much Space Does a Container Get?

By default:

✅ **As much space as is available on the host disk.**

E.g. if your `/var/lib/docker` partition has 100 GB free, your container could theoretically fill all 100 GB.

---

# ✅ But You *Can* Set Limits

If you want to **limit disk usage per container,** Docker lets you set quotas on the writable layer:

## ✔ On Overlay2 (most modern Linux distros):

Example — limit container to 1 GB:

```bash
docker run \
  --storage-opt size=1G \
  ubuntu
```

This restricts the container’s writable layer to **1 GB.**

**Note:**

* Only works on some storage drivers (overlay2 supports it).
* Doesn’t limit read-only image size, just the container’s own changes (writes).

---

## ✔ For Volumes

If you mount a volume:

```bash
docker run -v mydata:/data ubuntu
```

* Docker doesn’t impose a size limit by default.
* The volume can grow until your disk fills.

To limit volume sizes, you’d:

* Use external storage systems (like NFS quotas, or managed storage).
* Or create loopback devices with fixed sizes.

---

# ✅ Example — Limit Container Disk Size

Limit writable layer to 500 MB:

```bash
docker run -it --storage-opt size=500M ubuntu
```

Inside the container:

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=/bigfile bs=1M count=600
```

→ Will fail after about 500 MB.

---

# ✅ Docker Disk Usage Tools

Check how much space your containers, images, and volumes use:

```bash
docker system df
```

Example output:

```
TYPE            TOTAL     ACTIVE    SIZE      RECLAIMABLE
Images          3         2         1.2GB     800MB (66%)
Containers      2         2         150MB     0B (0%)
Local Volumes   3         2         500MB     100MB (20%)
Build Cache     0         0         0B        0B
```

---

# ✅ TL;DR

✅ On Linux:
→ You **must declare disk sizes** upfront (partitions, volumes).

✅ On Docker:
→ No disk size declared for containers by default.
→ Containers share the host disk.
→ You **can** set limits:

```
docker run --storage-opt size=1G ...
```

---

**Bottom line:**

> Unlike Linux partitions, Docker containers get as much disk as your host allows — unless you explicitly limit them.

Let me know if:

* You’d like to set quotas
* You’re dealing with Docker volumes
* You want to plan disk space for large models (e.g. Ollama)

…and I’ll help you size it precisely!
