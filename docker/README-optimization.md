I wouldn't have to store the chunk along with the vector, just the ID of the full document record. Does your code take this into account?

Excellent — that’s the next-level precision you absolutely should be thinking about.

✅ You’re exactly right:

You don’t have to store the chunk text itself along with the vector.
You could store:

the chunk embedding

plus a doc_id that points to the full document

Then, at retrieval time:

You do vector search over embeddings of chunks

But instead of pulling the chunk text from the DB, you simply:

get the matching doc_ids

load the full document(s)

✅ This is much more efficient for your final Gemini call, since:

you avoid accidentally mixing partial chunk texts

you keep your storage simpler

your retrieval logic becomes doc-level, even if your search is chunk-level

✅ How to Implement This in Practice
Let’s adjust the pipeline from the earlier example.

✅ What You Want to Store
In your DB (e.g. Postgres), store something like:

chunk_id	doc_id	embedding
1	A	[0.01, -0.34, ...]
2	A	[0.99, 0.21, ...]
3	B	[0.08, -0.13, ...]

So:
✅ You do NOT store the chunk text.
✅ You only store:

doc ID → tells you which full document to fetch later

the embedding vector

✅ Why You’d Do This
Less storage.

No need to manage chunk texts you’ll never send to Gemini.

Prevents partial-context hallucination.

✅ Adjusted Code Example
Here’s how to implement exactly that.

✅ Step 1 — Chunk the Document for Vectorization
python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_core.documents import Document

# Large document
full_doc_text = """
LangChain is a framework for building apps with large language models...
PGVector stores vectors in Postgres...
"""

# Split into chunks
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=500,
    chunk_overlap=50
)

chunks = splitter.create_documents([full_doc_text])

# Instead of keeping chunk text, store only doc_id
doc_id = "A"

# Create a list of minimal Document objects
chunk_docs = []
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    # NOTE: empty page_content
    chunk_docs.append(Document(
        page_content="",         # we won't store the chunk text
        metadata={
            "doc_id": doc_id,
            "chunk_num": i
        }
    ))
✅ These Documents carry:

no text

only metadata for doc ID

✅ Step 2 — Embed Only Chunk Texts
Now embed the chunk texts, but don’t store the texts themselves:

python
Copy
Edit
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")

# Compute embeddings for chunks
chunk_texts = [chunk.page_content for chunk in chunks]

# Each embedding matches one chunk
vectors = embeddings.embed_documents(chunk_texts)
✅ You now have:

list of embeddings → one per chunk

list of metadata → matching doc_id

✅ Step 3 — Store Embeddings + Metadata
If you’re using PGVector directly, you’d write SQL like:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO chunk_embeddings (doc_id, chunk_num, embedding)
VALUES
('A', 0, '[0.01, -0.34, ...]'),
('A', 1, '[0.99, 0.21, ...]');
Or, with LangChain’s PGVector wrapper:

python
Copy
Edit
from langchain_community.vectorstores.pgvector import PGVector

# Create Documents with embeddings
docs_to_store = []
for vector, doc in zip(vectors, chunk_docs):
    doc.metadata["embedding"] = vector
    docs_to_store.append(doc)

# Store them
vectorstore = PGVector.from_documents(
    documents=docs_to_store,
    embedding=None,   # embeddings are already computed
    connection_string="postgresql+psycopg2://langchain:langchain@localhost:6024/langchain",
    collection_name="my_vectors"
)
✅ Step 4 — Query the DB
Now when a user queries:

python
Copy
Edit
query = "Does LangChain integrate with Postgres?"

# Compute query embedding
query_embedding = embeddings.embed_query(query)

# Search vector store
results = vectorstore.similarity_search_by_vector(
    embedding=query_embedding,
    k=4
)
✅ Each result will be a Document like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Document(
    page_content="", 
    metadata={
        "doc_id": "A",
        "chunk_num": 1
    }
)
No chunk text needed!

✅ Step 5 — Fetch Full Docs by doc_id
Now collect your unique doc_ids:

python
Copy
Edit
# Get unique doc IDs
doc_ids = set(doc.metadata["doc_id"] for doc in results)
→ For each doc_id, fetch the entire doc from your database or storage:

python
Copy
Edit
# Hypothetical fetch
full_docs = []
for doc_id in doc_ids:
    # e.g. SQL:
    # SELECT full_text FROM full_docs WHERE doc_id = 'A';
    full_text = "The entire text for doc A..."
    full_docs.append(full_text)
✅ Step 6 — Send Full Docs to Gemini
Now concatenate and send them:

python
Copy
Edit
combined_context = "\n\n".join(full_docs)

prompt = f"""
You are a helpful assistant. Please answer this question using the following context.

CONTEXT:
{combined_context}

QUESTION:
{query}
"""

# Hypothetical Gemini call
from google.ai import GeminiClient

client = GeminiClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
response = client.chat(prompt=prompt)

print(response.text)
✅ Perfect:

retrieval stays chunk-level accurate

Gemini sees full documents for context

no wasted storage on chunk text

✅ Benefits of This Approach
✅ Super accurate search:

matching happens at chunk level

✅ Extremely efficient:

store only vectors + doc IDs

no duplicate chunk text

✅ Clean RAG pipeline:

ensures Gemini has the entire doc for context

✅ LangChain VectorStore Limitations
Note:

LangChain’s PGVector wrapper normally stores page_content automatically.

You’d have to tweak your vector store implementation slightly to store empty content or skip saving the text.

Alternatively, you can store vectors manually in Postgres instead of through LangChain wrappers.

✅ TL;DR
✅ You don’t have to store chunk text in your vector DB.
✅ Store:

chunk embedding

doc_id (metadata)

✅ Then:

search chunks for accurate retrieval

pull entire docs by doc_id for your LLM context

→ This is the best practice for high-accuracy RAG pipelines with large-context models like Gemini.

Bottom line:

Yes! Chunk for precise search, store only doc IDs, and feed entire docs to Gemini for powerful retrieval + reasoning.
