**Excellent question — AWS has definitely entered the vector database game. Let’s clarify exactly what they offer.**

✅ **Yes — AWS now offers several ways to store and search vectors.**

Let’s explore the landscape!

---

# ✅ 1. **Amazon OpenSearch Service (Vector Search)**

✅ **OpenSearch** (the AWS fork of Elasticsearch) now has native vector support:

* Store dense vector embeddings as fields in documents.
* Perform similarity search using:

  * cosine similarity
  * dot product
  * Euclidean distance

Example use case:

* Store text embeddings in OpenSearch.
* Query with an embedding → get top-k most similar documents.

**Great for:**

* RAG pipelines
* Hybrid search (text + vectors)

---

### Example:

```json
PUT my-index/_doc/1
{
  "text": "This is my document.",
  "vector": [0.018, -0.027, ...]
}
```

Query:

```json
{
  "size": 3,
  "query": {
    "knn": {
      "vector": {
        "vector": [0.5, 0.2, ...],
        "k": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

✅ **Managed by AWS** → scales easily.

---

# ✅ 2. **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL + pgvector**

✅ AWS Aurora PostgreSQL **supports the pgvector extension** natively.

* You can install `pgvector` in Aurora.
* Store vectors in a Postgres table.
* Run vector similarity queries.

Perfect for:

* Small to medium workloads.
* Simpler RAG pipelines integrated with existing relational data.

---

### Example:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;

CREATE TABLE docs (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    content text,
    embedding vector(1536)
);
```

Search:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM docs
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.021, -0.11, ...]'
LIMIT 5;
```

✅ **Aurora advantage:** serverless scaling + high availability.

---

# ✅ 3. **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL + pgvector**

Same as Aurora, but with RDS Postgres.

✅ You can install `pgvector` on any RDS PostgreSQL instance (from around version 13 onward).

**Ideal for:**

* Smaller-scale vector workloads
* Integrating vectors into existing relational databases.

---

# ✅ 4. **Amazon DynamoDB with Vectors (Custom)**

DynamoDB **does not have native vector search** yet.

BUT:

* You can store embeddings as arrays in DynamoDB.
* To search:

  * Retrieve items.
  * Compute similarity manually in your app.

✅ Not recommended for large vector workloads because:

* No native KNN indexing.
* No fast approximate search.

---

# ✅ 5. **Amazon Kendra (Semantic Search)**

Kendra is an AWS service for **enterprise search** with semantic capabilities.

* **Not a general-purpose vector DB.**
* Does use embeddings behind the scenes.
* Focused on searching documents, FAQs, PDFs, etc.

So if you want an **LLM-based retrieval pipeline**, Kendra might work — but it’s not a vector DB you can manage directly.

---

# ✅ 6. **Amazon Neptune ML**

Neptune (AWS’s graph database) has ML integration:

* Embeddings for graph nodes.
* Vector similarity queries.

✅ Cool for graph + embeddings.
❌ Not general-purpose vector DB for text retrieval.

---

# ✅ 7. **AWS Marketplace: Third-Party Vector DBs**

Many vector DB vendors run on AWS:

* Pinecone
* Weaviate
* Milvus
* Zilliz
* Vespa
* Chroma

✅ You can deploy them on AWS EC2, EKS, or via Marketplace AMIs.

But these are **not AWS-native services.** You’d run them yourself on AWS infrastructure.

---

# ✅ Most “AWS-Native” Options

If you want:
✅ **Managed AWS service + vector search** → use:

| Service                      | Managed | Good For             |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| OpenSearch                   | ✅       | Text + vector search |
| Aurora PostgreSQL + pgvector | ✅       | RAG pipelines        |
| RDS PostgreSQL + pgvector    | ✅       | Smaller workloads    |

These integrate well with the AWS ecosystem.

---

# ✅ Example: Using pgvector in Aurora

Enable pgvector in Aurora:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

Then store vectors:

```sql
CREATE TABLE embeddings (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    doc text,
    embedding vector(1536)
);
```

Insert:

```sql
INSERT INTO embeddings (doc, embedding)
VALUES ('my text', '[0.021, -0.02, ...]');
```

Search:

```sql
SELECT doc
FROM embeddings
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.5, -0.4, ...]'
LIMIT 5;
```

✅ Fully AWS-managed!

# ✅ TL;DR

✅ **Yes — AWS offers vector DB options!**

| Service                      | Vector Support?                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| OpenSearch                   | ✅ native vector fields           |
| Aurora PostgreSQL + pgvector | ✅ excellent for RAG              |
| RDS PostgreSQL + pgvector    | ✅ good for smaller workloads     |
| DynamoDB                     | ❌ not native vector search       |
| Kendra                       | ✅ semantic search, not vector DB |
| Neptune ML                   | ✅ graph embeddings               |

---

**Bottom line:**

> **AWS absolutely offers vector DB solutions,** mostly via OpenSearch or Postgres + pgvector. For pure vector search, Aurora + pgvector or OpenSearch are solid choices!

Let me know:

* Your data size
* Query speed requirements
* Or if you’d like code examples for any of these!
