    "- This happens at the start, and after every tool execution\n",

    "- OpenAI generates a tool call with the search query\n",
    "- The graph routes to the `tools` node, which executes the Tavily search\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this analogy: OpenAI is the \"brain\" that's always thinking, and Tavily is the \"research assistant\" that only gets called when the brain says \"I need to look something up.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example flow for your 30th president question:**\n",
    "1. **OpenAI called**: \"I need to search for info about the 30th president's age at death\"\n",
    "2. **Tavily called**: Searches for \"30th president of the United States age at death\"\n",
    "3. **OpenAI called again**: \"Based on the search results, Calvin Coolidge was 60 when he died\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you asked \"What's 2 + 2?\":**\n",
    "1. **OpenAI called**: \"I need to use the calculator tool\"\n",
    "2. **Calculator called**: `ast.literal_eval(\"2 + 2\")` → returns `4`\n",
    "3. **OpenAI called again**: \"The answer is 4\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tools_condition` function is what decides whether to route to tools or finish - it's like OpenAI's \"decision gate.\""

    "The `@tool` decorator is like a \"translator\" that converts your regular Python function into something the LLM can understand and use.\n",

    "- Tells the LLM: \"Hey, there's a function called 'calculator' that takes a string query and does math\"\n",
    "- The LLM can now generate tool calls to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like writing a job description - the `@tool` decorator creates a \"function description\" that the LLM can read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's what happens behind the scenes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Your function\n",
    "@tool\n",
    "def calculator(query: str) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"A simple calculator tool. Input should be a mathematical expression.\"\"\"\n",

    "{\n",
    "    \"name\": \"calculator\",\n",
    "    \"description\": \"A simple calculator tool. Input should be a mathematical expression.\",\n",
    "    \"parameters\": {\n",

    "        \"required\": [\"query\"]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why when you do `model.bind_tools(tools)`, the LLM knows it can call a function named \"calculator\" with a string parameter - all thanks to that `@tool` decorator acting as the \"interface\" between your Python code and the AI model."

    "## **The analogy:**\n",
    "Think of `tools_condition` like a **mail sorter** at the post office:\n",
    "- Looks at the last \"letter\" (AI message)\n",
    "- If it has \"tool call stamps\" → sends to \"tools department\" \n",
    "- If no stamps → conversation is \"delivered\" (ends)\n",

    "## **Try these examples to see different routing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Will route to tools**: `\"Search for Python tutorials\"`\n",
    "2. **Will NOT route to tools**: `\"Hello, how are you?\"`\n",
    "3. **Will route to calculator**: `\"What's 847293 * 652847?\"`\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Claude**: Uses `\"stop_reason\": \"tool_use\"` \n",
    "- **LangGraph handles this difference automatically!**\n",

    "- Same workflow structure\n",
    "- Different \"accents\" (API formats) \n",
    "- LangGraph translates between them automatically\n",

    "    model=\"claude-3-sonnet-20240229\", \n",
    "    temperature=0.1\n",

    "# Everything else stays identical!\n",
    "```\n",
