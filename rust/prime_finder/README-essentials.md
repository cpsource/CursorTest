There are **hundreds of thousands** of Rust packages (called "crates") available! Here's where to find them and the most popular ones:All Rust packages (called "crates") are available at **[crates.io](https://crates.io)** - the official registry with hundreds of thousands of crates. Here are the most popular ones:

## Essential Crates for Your Prime Finder:

**For CLI enhancement:**
```bash
cargo add clap --features derive    # Command-line arguments
cargo add indicatif                 # Progress bars  
```

**For better output:**
```bash
cargo add serde --features derive   # Data serialization
cargo add colored                   # Colored terminal output
```

## Top Must-Have Crates (2025):

**Most Popular:**
- **tokio** (75M+ downloads) - Async programming runtime
- **serde** (42M+ downloads) - Data serialization (like Python's json/pickle)
- **clap** (22M+ downloads) - CLI argument parsing (like Python's argparse)
- **reqwest** - HTTP client (like Python's requests)

**Categories to explore:**
- **Web:** `axum`, `rocket` (like Flask/Django)
- **Database:** `diesel`, `sqlx` (like SQLAlchemy)
- **Data:** `polars` (like pandas)
- **Crypto:** `ring`, `sha2`

## How to find crates:

1. **Browse by category:** [crates.io/categories](https://crates.io/categories)
2. **Search:** `cargo search "prime numbers"` 
3. **Curated lists:** Awesome Rust on GitHub

Think of it like this Python analogy:
- `crates.io` = PyPI
- `cargo add` = `pip install`
- Popular crates = packages like requests, pandas, flask

The ecosystem is huge and mature - there's probably already a high-quality crate for whatever you want to build! Start with the essentials (`serde`, `clap`, `tokio`) and grow from there.
