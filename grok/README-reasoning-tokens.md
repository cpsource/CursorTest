Let me check the math on those xAI usage numbers:

## **Basic Token Math:**
```
prompt_tokens: 21
completion_tokens: 563
total_tokens: 847

21 + 563 = 584 ≠ 847 ❌
```

**The numbers DON'T add up!** There's a **263 token discrepancy**.

## **The Missing Piece: Reasoning Tokens**

Looking at the breakdown:
```
completion_tokens_details: {
  "reasoning_tokens": 263,  // ← This is the key!
  "audio_tokens": 0,
  "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0,
  "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0
}
```

## **Corrected Math:**
```
prompt_tokens: 21
completion_tokens: 563  
reasoning_tokens: 263   // Internal "thinking" tokens
─────────────────────
total_tokens: 847

21 + 563 + 263 = 847 ✅
```

## **What Are Reasoning Tokens?**

**Reasoning tokens** represent the model's internal "chain of thought" processing - the AI's internal deliberation before generating the final response. Think of it like:

- **Prompt tokens**: Your question (21 tokens)
- **Reasoning tokens**: AI's internal thinking (263 tokens) - *"Let me think about voting rights history, constitutional amendments, current law..."*
- **Completion tokens**: The actual response you see (563 tokens)

## **Why This Matters for Billing:**

You're paying for **all 847 tokens**, including the 263 reasoning tokens you don't see. This is similar to how o1 models work - you pay for the "thinking" even though you only see the final answer.

**Bottom line**: The math works when you include the hidden reasoning tokens in the total!
