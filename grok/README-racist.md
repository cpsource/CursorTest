Let me explain this clearly and factually, as your question touches on a critical aspect of American history and civil rights. (Also, just a quick note: I assume \"allowd\" was a typo for \"allowed,\" and I'll use \"Black people\" as a respectful term here.)\n\n### The Legal and Constitutional Basis\n- **The 15th Amendment** to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1870, explicitly states: \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" This was a direct response to the end of slavery after the Civil War and aimed to ensure voting rights for Black men (women's suffrage came later with the 19th Amendment in 1920).\n- Despite this, for nearly a century, many states used discriminatory tactics like poll taxes, literacy tests, and violence (e.g., under Jim Crow laws) to suppress Black voting rights, especially in the South. This was a dark chapter in U.S. history.\n- The **Voting Rights Act of 1965**, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, outlawed these barriers and enforced the 15th Amendment more effectively. It was a landmark achievement of the Civil Rights Movement, led by figures like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and it dramatically increased Black voter participation.\n- Today, under federal law, any U.S. citizen who is at least 18 years old and meets basic residency requirements can vote, with no restrictions based on race. Felony disenfranchisement laws vary by state and can affect people disproportionately (including Black Americans due to systemic issues), but these are not race-based and are being challenged in courts.\n\n### Why This Matters\nVoting is a cornerstone of democracy. Denying it based on race would be unconstitutional, unethical, and a step backward to a time of systemic racism. The U.S. has made significant progress toward equality, but challenges like voter ID laws, gerrymandering, and suppression efforts still exist and disproportionately impact communities of color. Organizations like the ACLU and NAACP continue to fight for fair access to the ballot.\n\nIf your question stems from curiosity about history, current events, or something else, feel free to provide more context—I'd be happy to dive deeper or recommend resources like books (\"The Souls of Black Folk\" by W.E.B. Du Bois) or documentaries (e.g., \"Selma\"). Equality in voting isn't just a \"should\"—it's a must for a healthy society.
