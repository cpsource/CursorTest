**Function calling** in xAI (and other LLMs) means giving the AI the ability to **call external functions or tools** during a conversation, rather than just generating text responses.

## How Function Calling Works

Instead of just chatting, the AI can:
1. **Recognize when it needs external data** (weather, calculations, database queries)
2. **Call a specific function** with the right parameters
3. **Use the function's results** to give you a complete answer

## Example Workflow

**Without function calling:**
```
User: "What's the weather in Paris?"
AI: "I don't have access to current weather data..."
```

**With function calling:**
```
User: "What's the weather in Paris?"
AI: Calls → get_weather(city="Paris")
Function returns: {"temp": 15, "condition": "rainy"}
AI: "It's currently 15°C and rainy in Paris."
```

## xAI Function Calling Structure

You define available functions in your API call:

```python
functions = [
    {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather for a city",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "city": {"type": "string", "description": "City name"}
            },
            "required": ["city"]
        }
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-beta",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Weather in Tokyo?"}],
    functions=functions
)
```

## Common Use Cases

- **🌤️ Weather APIs** - Real-time weather data
- **📊 Database queries** - Look up specific information
- **🧮 Calculations** - Complex math or data processing
- **📧 Send emails** - Actually send messages
- **📅 Calendar management** - Check/create appointments
- **🔍 Web search** - Get current information
- **💰 Financial data** - Stock prices, exchange rates

## Response Format

When the AI decides to call a function, you get:

```json
{
  "choices": [{
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "function_call": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "arguments": "{\"city\": \"Paris\"}"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

You then execute the function and send the result back to continue the conversation.

## Why It's Powerful

**Think of it like giving the AI a toolbox** - instead of just knowing things, it can actually **do things**:
- Look up real-time data
- Perform actions in external systems
- Make calculations
- Access your databases
- Control other software

This is what makes modern AI assistants truly useful - they're not just chatbots, they're **AI agents** that can interact with the real world through function calls!
