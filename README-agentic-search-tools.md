An **agentic search tool** is a type of search system that doesn’t just retrieve information — it **acts like an intelligent agent**, capable of:

1. **Understanding your goal or intent**
2. **Decomposing tasks**
3. **Making decisions on what to search**
4. **Reasoning across multiple steps**
5. **Interacting iteratively** with data sources or APIs to get a better answer

### 🧠 Think of it this way:

Instead of asking:

> *"What’s the capital of France?"* (classic search)

You ask:

> *"Plan a 3-day itinerary in Paris based on my interests in art and food, and tell me where to book tickets."*

A **classic search engine** would return a bunch of links.
An **agentic search tool** will:

* Understand what you want.
* Break it down: find museums, restaurants, bookings.
* Query multiple APIs or documents.
* Reason over the results.
* Return a **final synthesized answer**.

### 🧩 Key Features of Agentic Search Tools:

| Feature                  | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Autonomous reasoning** | Makes decisions about what to do next                         |
| **Tool use**             | Calls APIs, web search, or functions                          |
| **Multi-step planning**  | Breaks queries into tasks and follows them                    |
| **State management**     | Remembers previous results to build on them                   |
| **Goal-oriented**        | Tries to solve a larger objective, not just answer a question |

### 🧰 Examples in the Wild:

* **LangChain Agents** or **AutoGPT-style tools** that perform searches, extract data, summarize, and write reports.
* **Perplexity AI Pro** with multi-step agent-based queries.
* **Google’s Gemini or DeepMind’s AlphaCode** doing code synthesis by exploring search queries and reasoning.

---

### 🛠️ In Short:

> **Agentic search = search + planning + tool use + reasoning**

It moves from *“search engine”* to *“autonomous problem solver with web access.”*
