# RAG Document Q&A System - Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

Think of this setup like building a Python web application - you need the backend server (FastAPI) and the frontend files (HTML/CSS) working together.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
```

### 2. Create Project Structure

```
rag-qa-system/
├── app.py                 # FastAPI backend server
├── static/
│   ├── index.html        # Main HTML file
│   └── styles.css        # CSS styles
└── uploads/              # Created automatically for uploaded files
```

### 3. Save the Files

1. **Backend**: Save the FastAPI code as `app.py`
2. **Frontend**: Create a `static/` directory and save:
   - HTML code as `static/index.html`
   - CSS code as `static/styles.css`

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd rag-qa-system

# Start the server
python app.py
```

The server will start at: **http://localhost:8000**

## 🔄 How It Works Now

**Complete File Upload Flow:**

```
Browser → FastAPI Server → File Storage → Processing → Database Ready
```

1. **User uploads file** → Browser sends to `/api/upload`
2. **FastAPI receives file** → Validates and saves to `uploads/` folder
3. **File gets processed** → (Simulated for now, real RAG processing would happen here)
4. **User asks question** → Browser sends to `/api/query`
5. **Server responds** → With AI-generated answer based on document

## 🛠️ What's Different from Gradio

| Feature | Gradio Version | This FastAPI Version |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **File Storage** | Temporary in memory | Persistent on disk |
| **Processing** | Built-in RAG components | Custom implementation needed |
| **Deployment** | Single command | Requires web server setup |
| **Customization** | Limited UI control | Full control over everything |

## 🔧 Next Steps for Real RAG

To make this a **real** RAG system, you'd add:

```python
# Document processing libraries
pip install langchain pypdf2 sentence-transformers chromadb

# Example RAG pipeline additions:
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import chromadb

# In your upload endpoint:
def process_document(file_path):
    # 1. Extract text from PDF/DOC
    text = extract_text(file_path)
    
    # 2. Split into chunks
    splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000)
    chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
    
    # 3. Create embeddings
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    embeddings = model.encode(chunks)
    
    # 4. Store in vector database
    client = chromadb.Client()
    collection = client.create_collection(file_id)
    collection.add(embeddings=embeddings, documents=chunks)
```

## 🚨 Current Limitations

- **Simulated responses**: No real AI processing yet
- **No vector database**: Files are stored but not searchable
- **No LLM integration**: Responses are template-based
- **Basic error handling**: Production would need more robust error management

## 🎯 Production Deployment

For deployment, you'd typically:

1. **Use a production server**: Gunicorn instead of Uvicorn
2. **Add a reverse proxy**: Nginx for static files
3. **Use cloud storage**: AWS S3 instead of local uploads
4. **Add authentication**: User accounts and API keys
5. **Use a real database**: PostgreSQL instead of in-memory storage

This setup gives you the **foundation** - like having a car with all the parts, but you still need to add the engine (real RAG processing) to make it fully functional!
